## ⚡ Get Started

### 1. Install `stocksimpy` (and `yfinance` for convenient data input)

```bash
pip install stocksimpy yfinance
```

### 2. Imports

```python
from stocksimpy import StockData, Backtester, Visualize, Performance
```

### 3. Load Data

```python
# If you want to load your own data from .csv, .sqlite or similar, use appropriate functions built into `StockData()`
data = StockData().from_yfinance([your_stock_symbol], your_starting_date, your_end_date)
```

### 4. Run Backtest

```python
# You can use your own strategy or one of the built-in ones for testing (e.g. Strategy.rsi_momentum_fixed())
bt = Backtester(your_stock_symbol, data, your_strategy)

# Depending on your strategy you may need to run bt.run_backtest_dynamic(), see more on the documentation
bt.run_backtest_fixed()
```

### 5. Evaluate the Results

```python
# View performance metrics like max drawdown and sharpe ratio
perf = Performance(bt)
print(perf.generate_risk_report())

# Visualize the graph
graph = Visualize(bt)
graph.visualize_backtest().show() # You can use .savefig(...) instead of .show() to record the graph in disk
```

And thats it, you just ran your first backtest 🚀
