What is stocksimpy?
--------------------
stocksimpy is a lightweight backtesting library designed for quick strategy testing without getting too deep into complex frameworks.

The goal is to make strategy testing simple, readable and fast. Especially for beginners, students, and anyone prototyping new ideas.

This project is still early in its development. The API may evolve as more features are added, edge cases get tested, and feedback comes in. If something feels unclear, missing, or limited, that’s expected at this stage.

Community input is central to shaping the library. Any suggestions, bug reports, strategy ideas, or architectural improvements are genuinely welcome. Whether you're an experienced quant or experimenting for the first time, contributions of all kinds help the project grow in the right direction.

Please don't hesitate to put on an issues on the [Github](https://github.com/SuleymanSade/stocksimpy) for any improvement that you would like to see in stocksimpy.
